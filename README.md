### Medication Alert Application

### Description :
  This is a "medication alert or reminder application" specially designed for 65+ years old. In our assignment the name called Suita Sharma who is a 65+ old women want to live healthier and better life. She is suffering with diabaties and heart realted diseases. She needs medication everyday, So i created an application which containes required medication and their details like "medicine name","uses","schedule time". people like Sunita can check their medication for "morning","afternoon"and "night".This application reminds them to take their medication on time with an alert message so that people can manage their medication everyday without the help of care givers.
  
  Approach to complete the Project:
  
     Features:
     
       -First I divided the entire application into different Routes like Medicine,MedicationHeader,MorningRoute,AfternoonRoute,NightRoute etc.,

     Technologies:

       -For buliding and responsiveness of the application I use "React"
       - For styling I Use "CSS"
       - For Debugging I use "Browser Developers Tools" 
       
     Tools:  
       - To develop this Application I use a platform called ccbp IDE which is based on VS code
       - For Source control --> Git 

     Why React Js :
        React Js was choosen to build more performant websites with less code when compared to Js. 
        And also it is open sorce with strong community and third-party packages 

     Third-party packages:
        react
        react-router-dom ---> For navigating from one route to another route 
        react-icons 
        react-toastify ---> For creating toast messages 

     Challenging and Exciting Approaches :
        - One of the challenging approach is creating alert messages using third-party package react-tosatify 
        - Another one creating popups for info and about us section.

     Industry Ready Practices :
        - Most of the developers in the real world uses the concept called react hooks. With the help of react hooks we call the state in the functional component intself without using the class componnents. 
          In the project I use the both react hooks concept with functional component and also I use class components based on the requirement.
